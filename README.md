# Airmint- keep your community engagedðŸŽ¯

AirMint is a B2B SAAS platform that offers tools to communities to improve their engagement with holders and drive growth. We track and synthesize on-chain and off-chain data in real time, and provide communities with customizable rewards APIs that allow them to reward their most engaged and loyal holders with rewards such as Poaps, exclusive merchandise, airdrops of rare NFTs, whitelists, money, collaboration opportunities with other users or creators, recognition on landing pages, and more. The platform also integrates AI to analyze holder engagement data and detect fraudulent activities, and provides recommendations on how to allocate rewards to engaged users. AirMint operates on a freemium subscription model ranging from $0 to $10,000 per month, and is designed for third-party integrations.

## DASHBOARD

There is one main page inside **/pages** directory: i**ndex.js** in **/dashboard/[projectAddress]** direcory. It is setting up a page that displays a dashboard for a project. Among from other components it imports an API and the 'Client' object from a library for interacting with the Twitter API. The '**getServerSideProps**' function fetches data from an API to later on use it in Leaderboard page. The function is executed on the server before the page is rendered, and the data it returns is passed as props to the 'Dashboard' function. The dashboard page includes a navigation bar with links to different parts of the dashboard, and a main area that displays one of three different components depending on the current tab: an overview, a leaderboard, or a profile page. The page also includes a logout button that removes a token from local storage and redirects the user to the homepage.

All **pages** that are displayed in dashboard(**Leaderboard, Overview, Profile and Quests**) are located under **/components/dashboard** directory. Most of them is pretty simple and self-descripive:

- **Leaderboard:** It's receiving holders and address props. It's rendering a simple leaderboard with score for every holder.

- **Overview:** For now it's empty, but ultimately that's where project founders will be able to see some charts and summaries.

- **Profile:** For now in profile page there are just two dummy forms that need to be connected to the backend(style and metrics for the project).

- **Quests:** It displays a **list of quests** for a given project. Address passed in props refers to project address and based on that right when the page is rendered all quests are fetched by "useEffect" hook which calls **fetchQuests()** function that is **fetching all quests based on the address**. Each quest is rendered with an **icon that is based on the quest type**. It also has a button for **creating new quest**(it opens a New Quest modal). After clicking on a quest it will open a quest modal where you will be able to see everyone who has interacted with the project's Twitter in a given amount of time(for count endpoints) or all holders who interacted with a specific tweet. More on that in the modals section.

All **modals** that are used accross the app are located under **/components/modals**. Each of them has a common component called ModalBackground, which blurs the background and receives an onClose function in a prop to close the modal when user clicks outside of it.

- **HolderModal:** It's a simple modal that's made to display holder details. For now it's unfinished. Let's add there a chart with the user score history.
- **LoginModal:** Simple modal for projects to log in. It's saving project and JWT in localStorage.
- **SignupModal:** Simple signup modal for projects. It's saving project and JWT in localStorage.
- **NewQuest:** Modal for creating new quests. For quest types that require the tweet id it is displaying tweet id input and for more general types of quests it is diplaying timerfame input where you can select the dates.
- **QuestModal:** Quest modal is displaying either all participants from the quest or only these holders who are logged in to Airmint(it's checking if participant has signed up to Airmint in useEffect hook on render) If the user is logged in to airmint it is diplaying a Twitter pfp and a reward button.
- **RewardModal** There are two forms there one for sending ERC20 tokens and the other one for sending NFTs.

## NPM PACKAGE

For now there is just LoginButton that is fetching and printing the metrics you need to calculate the score. We must add many more components to this

## What we need make it a full MVPðŸŽ¯

- Connecting forms in the project's profile page to backend (metrics and styles)
- Designing an Overview page (some chart?, leaders, recent quests etc.)
- Finishing holder profile modal
- Designing a landing page
- Secure everything
- Adding filters and sorting to leaderboard and quest modal
- Adding appropriate Twitter and Discord authorization buttons to sign up modal (instead of pasting links)
- Developing a simple npm package (customizable leaderboard and quest board with easy log in with privy)
- Developing blockchain side(Airdrop smart contract, sending NFTs and ERC20 tokens) and connect it with frontend
- Adding option to select the specific time(at least an hour) for quest to start
- Adding even more metrics that the score will be based on
- Adding even more quest options (unfortunately Twitter API is not helping with that too much)
- Writing a script to update all scores every 24h
- Securing the API with requireAuth
